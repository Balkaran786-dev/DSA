1. Heat Map:-

A heat map is a data visualization tool that uses color to represent 
the magnitude of values in a dataset. The intensity of the color 
indicates the magnitude, making it easy to identify patterns, trends,
and outliers.


2. Line chart:-
A line chart is a type of data visualization used to display information as
 a series of data points connected by straight lines. 
 It is commonly used to track changes or trends over time or to 
 compare multiple datasets.


3. Bar chart:-
A bar chart is a data visualization tool used to compare categories or groups of data.
 It represents values with rectangular bars, where the length or height of each bar
  corresponds to the data value it represents.

  horizontal:
  1.when category name is large.
  2.focus is on comparison between categories rather than their numerical values.
  3.large number of categories.

  vertical:
  1.focus on magnitude.
  2.short category labels.


4.pie chart:
A pie chart is a circular statistical chart used to show proportions or 
percentages of a whole. Each "slice" of the pie represents a category, 
with the size of the slice corresponding to its proportion of the total.


5.pareto chart:
specialized bar chart,with bars arranged in desecending order.
based on pareto principle (80/20) principle,whixh says 80% effect 
comes from 20 % causes.


6.histogram
A histogram is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. 
It uses bars to show the frequency of data points falling within specified ranges, 
called bins. Unlike a bar chart, a histogram groups data into intervals and is ideal 
for analyzing continuous data.


7.Bubble chart:
A bubble chart is a data visualization tool that displays three dimensions of data simultaneously 
using circles (bubbles). It is an extension of a scatter plot, where an additional
 variable determines the size of the bubbles.


8.A scatter plot is a type of data visualization used to show the relationship between
 two variables. It plots data points on a two-dimensional graph, with one variable on
  the x-axis and the other on the y-axis.

9.Area plot:
An area plot is a data visualization tool used to represent quantitative data, 
similar to a line chart but with the area under the line filled in with color or 
shading. It is typically used to emphasize trends over time or show the contribution 
of individual parts to a whole.n an area plot, the area under the curve represents the cumulative total 
of the values over time or across categories. 


10.Funnel chart:
A funnel chart is a specialized data visualization tool used to represent 
stages in a process and show the decline in values at each stage. 
The chart is typically shaped like a funnel, with the largest values at 
the top and the smallest values at the bottom, illustrating how data progressively
 narrows down through each stage.


11.Stacked Bar chart:
Compares the total value of categories while showing how 
different sub-groups contribute to that total.


A 100% stacked bar chart is a variation of the stacked bar chart 
where each bar represents 100% of a category, and the segments within the
 bar show the proportional contribution of sub-groups to the whole. 


12. Violin plot is a data visualization that combines aspects of both a box plot 
and a kernel density plot. It is used to display the distribution of a dataset, 
showing its probability density at different values. The plot is particularly useful 
for comparing the distribution of several categories or groups within the dataset.


13.A swarm plot is a type of data visualization used to display the distribution of 
categorical data by plotting individual data points on a 2D plane. It is similar to
a scatter plot but specifically designed for categorical data, where each point is
positioned along the x-axis based on its category and along the y-axis based on its value.


14.A Sankey diagram is a type of chart used to show how things (like money, energy, 
or resources) move between different stages or categories. It uses arrows, and 
the thicker the arrow, the bigger the amount being moved. It helps you easily 
see where things are coming from and where theyâ€™re going.
