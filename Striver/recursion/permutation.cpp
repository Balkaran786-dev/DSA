/*why time complexity of generating all permutations is n!??
The number of permutations of 𝑛 distinct items is 𝑛!
because of how choices multiply at each step. Here's the reasoning:

First Position: You have 𝑛 options for which element to place in the first position.
Second Position: you have n-1 choices

in this way, n*n-1*n-2---> n!
