1. SR (Set-Reset) Flip-Flop
Working Principle:

The SR flip-flop has two inputs: S (Set) and R (Reset).
When S is high and R is low, the flip-flop sets (output Q = 1).
When S is low and R is high, the flip-flop resets (output Q = 0).
If both S and R are low, the output retains its previous state (no change).
If both S and R are high simultaneously, the output is undefined, leading to an indeterminate state.
Advantages:

Simple design and easy to understand.
Useful in basic latch circuits and simple memory elements.
Disadvantages:

The undefined state when S and R are both high can be problematic.
Circuit Diagram:

The most common form is a cross-coupled NAND or NOR gate configuration.


2. JK Flip-Flop
Working Principle:

The JK flip-flop is an improvement over the SR flip-flop and resolves the indeterminate state issue.
It has two inputs: J and K.
When J is high and K is low, the flip-flop sets (Q = 1).
When J is low and K is high, the flip-flop resets (Q = 0).
When both J and K are high, the output toggles (Q switches from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1).
When both J and K are low, the output remains unchanged.
Advantages:

Eliminates the undefined state of the SR flip-flop.
Versatile, as it can function as an SR flip-flop, a D flip-flop, or a T (toggle) flip-flop.
Disadvantages:

Slightly more complex than the SR flip-flop.
Requires more gates to implement.

Circuit Diagram:

Typically implemented using NAND gates and feedback connections


3. D-Flip Flop
Working Principle:

The D flip-flop has a single data input D and a clock input.
On the rising (or falling) edge of the clock, the input D is transferred to the output Q.
The output remains constant until the next clock edge.
Ensures that only one input (the data input D) can affect the output, preventing indeterminate states.
Advantages:

Simple and easy to use for data storage.
Ideal for applications requiring data synchronization.
Prevents the issue of indeterminate states as seen in the SR flip-flop.

Data Transfer:
When the clock signal transitions from low to high (or high to low for negative-edge triggering), the value present at the D input is transferred to the output Q.
The output Q remains stable and unchanged until the next triggering edge of the clock signal, regardless of changes in the input D.
Disadvantages:

Less versatile than the JK flip-flop in terms of additional functionalities.
Circuit Diagram:

Commonly implemented using a combination of NAND or NOR gates or as a master-slave configuration to ensure edge triggering.







**A logic gate is an electronic circuit that performs a basic logical operation on 
one or more binary inputs to produce a single binary output. It is the building 
block of digital circuits.

XOR Gate - Outputs 1 if inputs are different.
XNOR Gate - Outputs 1 if inputs are the same (NOT + XOR).

Why BCD Doesn't Handle Numbers Greater Than 9?
BCD is a hybrid of binary and decimal systems. EEach 4-bit group represents a single decimal digit (0–9). The binary representations 
1010
1010 (10) to 
1111
1111 (15) in 4 bits are invalid in BCD, as they do not correspond to any valid decimal digit.


Why Add 6?
The decimal equivalent of 
6
6 compensates for the gap between the highest valid BCD value (
9
9) and the smallest invalid binary value (
10
10).
Mathematically:

6
10−4=6 (in binary:

1010−0100=0110).
