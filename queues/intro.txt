we know there was concept of LIFO in stacks.

here in queues,
we have FIFO(first in first out) or FCFS(first come first serve) in queue.
jo pehle aya,wo pehle process hoga.

#queue is a data structure that supports FIFO.
#queue is a linear data structure.

$operations on queues:
::Enqueue: this operation will help us to add a new client in the queue.
::Dequeue: this operation will help us to remove a new {means(jo sabse pehle add hua hai)} element in the queue.



::Is_full: tells if queue is full.
::Is_empty: tells if queue is empty.
::front: gives the first ele in the queue or the ele that came first.
::size: gives us current size of the queue .


front:trackes the first ele.removal is done from here.
back: where any new ele is added.

$Types of queues:
#Simple queue: in which front points to the ele that is added firstly in the queue.
               Through front,we access our first element.
               elements are removed from front and added from back.
#Priority queue: in which front is pointing to some customised ele based on some priorty.ex,Largest or smallest ele etc.
#circular queue: in which front is present after the back.
#Double ended queue/Deque: in which insertion and deletion can be done from both sides i.e front and Back.
