Two conditions:
overflow:
jitni stack ki capacity thi,if you cross that capacity,you hit the overflow condition.

underflow:
when no ele is present and you want to either access or delete the ele,you hit the underflow condtion.

//STACKS USING ARRAYS
if top index is==-1,then we are either in underflow or no ele are added yet.
:we make a class of stacks.
::we have array as a prop. ::we make capacity as a prop
and ::we have top_index as a prop which initially points to -1.

all these prop are private to the class,as you don't want anyone the access the array from outside the class.


#when we want to push ele,we increase the top_idx by 1 and we add the 
ele as array[top_idx]=ele.
  
#when you pop,you just take back the top _idx backward by subratcting -1;

#if you want see if stack is full,check if top_idx==arr.size()-1;

#if you want see if stack is empty,check if top_idx==-1


//STACKS USING LINKED LIST
head=top_ele.
push==insertion at head  yeah top pe a jayega.
pop==deletion at head
