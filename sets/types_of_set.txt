##unordered set:
->values are stored in unordered fashion.
->unique values,values will be defined by itself,
values cannot be modified inside the set.
->Insertion,Deletion,Search all have avg time complexity-o(1).
 because unordered set are internally implemented by hashing.

MEMBER FUNCTION OF UNORDERED_SET:
1.Insert
     single element- o(1) avg
                     o(N) worst,it happens when the number elements of unordered set becomes greater than its capacity.So,we need to rehash 
                           all elements and insert them in a bigger size unordered set. 

     Multiple elements- o(n) avg, where n is no. of elements being inserted.
                      - o(n*(N+1)) worst,where n is no. of elements being inserted,N is size of unordered set.

2.Deletion 
     erase(value),erase(position),erase(start_itr,end_itr)

     single_ele-o(1) avg     multiple_ele-o(n),where n is no.of elements to be deleted.
               -o(N) worst
3.find()
     o(1) -avg
     o(N) -worst

4. count()
     o(1) -avg
     o(N) -worst
(hashing:)
5. load_factor- size_of_unordered_set/bucket_count;

6. rehash(x)- sets the no.of buckets to x or more.
              o(N) avg
              o(N**2) worst


all other function are similar to ordered set function

##Multiset:
->it can store duplicate values.
-> values stored in ordered manner(either inc or dec),value
 will be identified by itself,values cannot be modified in mutliset.

MEMBER FUNCTION OF MULTISET:
1.Insert-  o(logN)
2.deletion- erase(value) - o(logN)    1 2 2 3 4  erase(2)- gives us 1 3 4
            erase(position) - o(logN)
            erase(start_pos,end_pos) - o(N)

3. find()- o(logN)  returns lowerbound of element if found else end iterator

4.count()- o(k+logN),where k is no. of occurrences 
5.lower_bound()-o(logN) 
                 returns an iterator to the first ocuurence of the given
                 key else returns an iterator to the next greater ele.If the 
                 given key is greater than the maximum value of the set, it returns end iterator.
6.upper_bound()-o(logN) 
                  returns an iterator to the next greater ele of the specified key.if the given 
                  key is equall to or greater than the maximum ele of set,it returns end iterator.


##unordered_Multiset
->allows duplicate values
->values are not ordered.
->values are identified by itself.
->values cannot be modified.

MEMBER FUNCTION OF UNORDERED_MULTISET:
1. Insert: 
    single ele-  o(1) avg   o(N) worst
    multiple ele-  o(n) avg   o(n*(N+1)) worst.

2. deletion: 
    erase()  
    single_ele-o(1) avg     multiple_ele-o(n),where n is no.of elements to be deleted.
               -o(N) worst
               where N is size of our unordered_multiset.
