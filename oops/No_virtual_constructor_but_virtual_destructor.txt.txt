REASONS:- why no virtual constructor exist?

1.When an object is created, the type of the object is already known at compile time, 
so there's no need for the polymorphic behavior that virtual provides.

2.Virtual functions work by looking up the appropriate function in a vtable, 
but an object does not have a vtable until it is constructed.



why virtual destructor is present and used?
A virtual destructor is essential in C++ when dealing with inheritance and polymorphism.
It ensures that when an object is deleted through a pointer to a base class, 
the destructor of the derived class is called first, followed by the base class destructor.
This guarantees that the entire object is properly destroyed, preventing resource leaks
and undefined behavior.
