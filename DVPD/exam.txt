How map data is stored
Raster:
What it is: Made of tiny squares called pixels.
Example: Think of a photo taken with your phone. If you zoom in, you see tiny squares (pixels).
Scaling: If you make it bigger, it gets blurry or pixelated.
Best for: Photos,images,JPEG

Vector:
What it is: Made of lines and shapes defined by math, not pixels.
Example: Think of a logo. You can make it as big or small as you want, and it always looks clear.
Scaling: Can be resized without losing quality.
Best for: Logos, icons, and simple graphics,CSV.
