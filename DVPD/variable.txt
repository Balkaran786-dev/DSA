categorical variable:A categorical variable is a type of variable that can take on one of a limited, 
fixed number of possible values, often representing distinct groups or categories. 
Unlike numerical variables, categorical variables are qualitative and do not have a mathematical or logical ordering between their values.


individuals:individuals can be people, objects, or any other entities for which data is recorded, depending on the context of the research or analysis.


1.Categorical data types represent data that can be divided into distinct groups or categories. 
These data types are typically used when the variable represents labels, classifications, or groups
that don't have a natural numerical order (in the case of nominal data) or where the order exists but the distance 
between categories is not defined (in the case of ordinal data).
2 types :
**Nominal Data:
Represents categories that have no inherent order or ranking.
Examples:
Gender (Male, Female, Non-binary)
Eye color (Blue, Brown, Green)
Country of residence (USA, UK, Canada)


**Ordinal Data:
Represents categories that have a specific, meaningful order, but the intervals between values are not consistent or known.
Examples:
Education level (High School, Bachelor’s, Master’s, Ph.D.)
Satisfaction rating (Poor, Fair, Good, Excellent)

 
2.Numerical Data
Definition: Data that represents measurable quantities and can be either discrete or continuous.
Types:
Discrete: Countable data (e.g., number of books, number of cars).
Continuous: Data that can take any value within a range (e.g., weight, height, temperature).
Common Visualizations:
Histograms: For displaying the distribution of continuous data.
Line Charts: Ideal for tracking changes over time or continuous trends.
Scatter Plots: Used to explore relationships between two continuous numerical variables


3.Time series data.




different plot for diff purpose:
1.relationships: scatter plot(relationship between two variables),Bubble chart(Relationship between x & y & Bubble size).
2.Comparison: Bar chart,line chart
3. distribution: histogram,Box plot
4. composition: Pie chart,stacked bar chart,stacked area chart.


characteristics of data:
1. Plentiful
2. Beautiful
3. Insightful ex pollution in china.
4. powerful
5. can be deceitful



The Ponzo illusion is a well-known optical illusion that illustrates 
how the human brain interprets depth and perspective.In the Ponzo illusion, 
two horizontal lines of equal length are placed over a background of converging lines 
The converging lines create a sense of depth, as they mimic the appearance of parallel 
lines converging in the distance due to perspective. Because of this, 
the top line appears longer than the bottom line, even though both lines are actually the same length.
This illusion occurs because our brain interprets the converging lines as representing depth, and 
thus assumes that the top line is farther away.


Tufte's
:Audience is intelligent
:Convince and convey the readers.
• Show the data
• Maximize data-ink ratio
• Erase non data ink (as much as possible)
• Erase Redundant data ink
• Avoid Chart junk (moire, ducks)
• Try to increase the density of data ink
• Graphics should tend to be horizontal



Tufte’s principles are widely respected in the field of data 
visualization because they emphasize clarity, efficiency, and truthfulness,
 ensuring that visual representations of data are both beautiful and informative


1.Maximise data ink ratio
2.erase Redundant data
3.emphasize on data  variation,not on style variation.
4.Integarte words number images.
5.Avoid chart junks
6.Tell the truth 


Some Chart Rules
• Bar charts must start at zero [most axis will start at zero]
• Avoid too many pie slices
• Respect part of a whole (in pie charts)
• Show the data: small multiple, aggregation, transparency.
• Chart must be self-explanatory
 Explain encoding (what means what)
• Label Axes
• Include units
• Circle size by area, not diameters
