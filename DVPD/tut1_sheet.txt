Q1.
Question 1: Steps to Accomplish the Task
:Requirement Analysis: Define user needs and features (input location, output solar radiation).
:Data Collection: Gather historical weather data, geographical attributes, and solar radiation data.
:Data Preprocessing: Clean and prepare data (handle missing data, normalization).
:Feature Engineering: Select relevant features (e.g., cloud cover, temperature) for the ML model.
:Model Selection: Choose and train an ML/statistical algorithm for prediction (e.g., Random Forest, Neural Networks).
:Web Application Development: Develop a GIS-enabled web interface for input and display of predictions.
:Deployment and Testing: Test the system, deploy it on a web server, and ensure scalability.


Question 2: Data Sources

Satellite data (e.g., NASA, Copernicus)
Weather stations (e.g., NOAA, local weather services)
Historical solar radiation datasets (e.g., PVGIS, NSRDB)

Question 3: Types of Data
Geospatial Data: Latitude, longitude, elevation.
Meteorological Data: Temperature, humidity, cloud cover.
Time Series Data: Solar radiation over time.

Question 4: What Can You Visualize?
Solar radiation predictions on a map.
Time-series charts of predicted radiation for specific locations.
Heatmaps of solar potential across regions.

Question 5: Which Part Requires Visualization?
Input Visualization: Location input on a map.
Output Visualization: Solar radiation predictions, heatmaps.
Model Evaluation: Performance metrics like error rates and accuracy graphs.
