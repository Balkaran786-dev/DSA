STL:standard template library

#set of template classes for implementing commonly 
used data structures and functions

#it gives a lot of template classes for different data structures and functions
so that we can directly use it in code without actually defining those.
ex:
lists,set,map,queue,stacks etc.
vector is also a part of STL.

3 major components of STL:1.Containers 2.iterators 3.algorithm
1.Containers: use template classes
object used to hold data of the same type.
 ex: vector: class that defines a dynamic array.
     list: class for doubly linked list
     map: used to store unique key value pairs.
     set: used to store unique values.

2.Iterators: object points to an element in container.
->used to iterate/traverse the container.
->pointers like entities.
how to define it by example:

ex: vector<int> V={1,2,3,4,5};
    vector<int> :: iterator itr;
    itr.begin()   //it gives us 1

3.Algorithm: use template functions
functions that are used to manipulate data in the container.
ex: sort(): in vectors,sort(v.begin(),v.end())
    min() : min(a,b)
    max() : max(a,b)
