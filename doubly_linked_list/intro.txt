Blocks of memory that are called nodes
each node will point to the next node and the previous node.
so,every node contain two pointers.


#advantages of doubly linked list over singly linked list.
1.Traversal can be done both ways. head to last node and also we can traverse from last to head node.
2.insertion and deletion becomes more efficient and easier.

#disadvantage:
1.extra space for previous node pointer.

| prev | val | next|
---------------------
val is value stored in the node
prev pointer is pointing to the previous node.
next pointer is pointing to the next node.
